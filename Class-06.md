* Object literal is when you make an object and literally assign the properties and methods the object will have
*Objects are different from arrays in that arrays are referenced in numerical order according to its index length, where as a Object's properties and methods are called or referenced by the corresponding key value within that object.
*The term 'this' is referencing the objects name, so that when using dot notation you do not have to type out the entire objects name incase it is a long name
