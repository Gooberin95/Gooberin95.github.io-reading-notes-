### Local storage. 
1. Local storage makes understanding the state of affairs in a script much easier, it allows you a single point of origin or truth to reffer to in times of needing data, or needing peristence with your data across page refreshes 
2. Info should not be stored in local storage if the user intends to keep it for long lengths of time and intends to utilize the data further on which would require long term storage. 
3. Local storage can store json and xml, You can convert that type to a string or array so you can then store it before it is json
