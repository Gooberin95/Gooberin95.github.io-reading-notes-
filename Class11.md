#Video and Audio Content
1. Old technologies such as Flash and Silverlight were the beginning of video and audio on the web, they were not native to html and had alot of security and accessability issues compared to today. 
2. src allows the same functionality as the img tag, it containts path to video you want to embed, and controls allows an interface to show up in the browser
3. Fallback content allows for atleast someway for users to access the content if the browser happens to be old
4. There was a rabbit named video, he once had a job that required him to call clients and ask them to fill out forms on review of his company, video once made a call to a client and Audio pick up! who was an old friend he had from highschool. They both started to apply to the HTML organization and ended up becoming millionares there
# A complete guide to grid
1. grid is 2 dimensional where as flex is one directional flow
2. Grid line is the dividing line that makes up the structure of the grid layout, it is either column or row oriented, grid-container determines which element is the parent element of all grid items specified, grid-item defines which elements are the children of the parent grid element
# Responsive images
1. Making images responsive will result in less wasted bandwidth for cellular or smaller screen size users
2. src set defines which images we are going to let the browser pick from defined in a list we provide, sizes allows us to provide media conditions to the browser to specifiy which size of image is best to choose from
3. Sourceset tag is better at doing the job of creating responsive images because since it is native to the html markup language it allows for smoother and cleaner implemenation as well as less drain on bandwidth for end users.
