# Javascripot Canvas
1. Canvas allows you to draw 2D graphics with javascript within a specified area using the canvas tag
2. The closing tag is important because when we close the tag, anything between the closing tag and opening tag will show in the browser when desired content cant be displayed for what ever reason.
3. getContext() is a method of canvas that returns a render context object
# Chart.js
 Chart.js is an open source library, you bring it into your code through a CDN link
 Types of charts you can use are Bar, Area and Bubble chart
 ---
an advantage to displaying data in a chart vs a table is that it is much easier to make and visually more appealing than tables
I could benefit from adding this to our previous labs by making the numbers display in chart form instead of a boring old table which is hard to understnad visually compared to a table. 
### Things I want to know more about
I am woundering how often this chart.js is actually utilized over other more non-technical software like excel or other microsoft products
