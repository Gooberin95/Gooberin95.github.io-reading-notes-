# Domain modeling 
* Domain modeling is important because it defines a vocabulary that is useable between both buisness and technical teams# Html table basics
* Tables shoudl not be used for page layouts because the Document or DOM is more useful and maluable to specific needs.
* < tr > < th > and < td > are used within the table element.
# Introducing constructors
* A constructor is a high level abstraction of a function or object that allows us to do more with less code. 
* "This" is different when used in a object-literal vs a constructor, constructor will make it bound to the the new object, and object-literal only referres the the single object its within.
* Prototypes are like a boss who has a set of pre-organized plans given to him by the company which are useable by him at any given time, where inheritance would be the nature of the relationship of my boss and his company and the ability of access to prototypes this gives him. 

### Things I want to know more about 
## I am curious about what the standard is of making websites? Like can most people who do this for a living bust out a decent website from scatch in a day or two? or is it okay to need to do research for a catalyst of sorts.
