###  Class 08 notes

* Flexbox being designed for one-dimensional content means that it takes a group of items and displays them in one dimension
* The main axis is the direction of the layout your items will be layed out in, cross-axis will always be the opposit of this when setting flex-direction
*The tabbing fuctionality for accessability follows the DOM so adjusting the visual display with flexbox can disrupt this navigation for some users

### CSS Layout - Flexbox
1. An advantge of using float over flex-box is that float is a legacy method of applying css to html dom
2. This topic connects with my long term goal because I need to make my code look profesional and appealing to clients I am working for or with
### Things I want to know more about
* I am woundering if people end up just saving their css code on usb drives for use later on in the future or if they end up mostly just using bootstrap for quicker results. Also I am curious what the advantage is to personal css over bootstrap
