# HTML Forms
* Forms are important in web development because they allow collecting of data from users and also allow users to control the user interface if built for that purpose.
*You will want to keep the users experience in mind when styling the input fields and also when you are creating the type value for the input fields, the desired answer must be communicted through your design
1. "Text area": Important for receiving a multi-line response form the end user
2. "Select": Important for allowing the user to select from among a tailored list of options
3. "Option": Important as a child element to the "Select" element which allows the rendering of text to describe options of answering
4. "Optgroup": Important for creating visualy grouped together answer options for the end user to choose from
5. "Datalist": Important for giving autocompleted values for the end user to choose from which "Option" element as its child elements
# Introduction to events
* Events are interactions which occur between the end user and your web page that you intend to obtain data from or have your web page react to how you so choose
* You need to provide the event type as well as the callback function(also called handler)
*The event object acts as a mechanism that you wire to your specifications so that when interacted with in a specific way your desired change in the browser or wepage occurs. The target within the event object is important because it specifies what your want your desired change to effect.
*Event bubbling causes an element to be affected from inner to outer, where as an event capture goes from outter to innder element.
