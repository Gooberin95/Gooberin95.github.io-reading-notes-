## Learn HTML

* This topic matters because it is related to how Javascript arrays are made, manipulated and removed. This helps us access tons of Javascript capabilites because it all ties together. 
* 

* I would love to know what commands for manipulating arrays are exactly the same as some of the python commands. I am going to look these up later
* You should use an unordered list in HTML when the items are not arranged in a particular order or they are not numerically filed
* You can change the bullet style of your unordered list items by putting "list-style-type: ___;" in your css
* You are also able to change your "Ordered-list" numeric values with "custom-ident" attribute in your css(you cans also put any alphabetic numerical character as well
* In HTML you use an ordered- list when you have items given an numeric value or pre-assigned order of importance and you use an un-ordered list when you are given a list of items with no particular order or pre-assigned value of importance
## Learn CSS
_The Box Model_: By **Brandon Ruiz**
Once upon a time there were three little pigs, they wanted to access the big bears straw house,Piglet 1's name is MARGIN and MARGIN was able to get inside the straw house by going first to the top then the right then the bottom and finally the left of the house which he then found the Golden Key to the big bears straw house. Piglet 2's name was PADDING and PADDING was a fat pig that could only go to the top and right of the house due to his high cholesterol so he never got in since he could only provide 2 values. 
## Learn JS
* You can store numerical and string data types inside of arrays as well as other arrays
* The array _people_ is not a valid Javascript array because *null* is not a valid data type for Javascript arrays
* Here are five short hand operators in Javascript along with what they do
  * *+=* This adds a desired value to an already established value or variable
  * *-=* This subtracts a desired value from an already established value or variable
  * *++* This will add 1 to any already established value or variable
  *  *= This will multiply by a desired integer and assign the value to any already established variable or value
  *  *...* This will iterate an entire array short hand when needed
  *  The result of (a + c) + b; should be nothing because it is adding integer with string data types which does not compute
  *  A real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in Javascript could be when you are making an app for accepting tickets into a movie theater and you must evaluate if the scanned ticket has actually been purchased and marked down in inventory or not
  *  A Loop in Javascript if very useful when you need to iterate or due a task a certain amount of times where it becomes time consuming to hand code each iteration out

## Things I want to know more about 
I am curious about how many developers in the tech industry use Vim instead of vscode
