# Class-04 notes
## Creating Hyperlinks
1. To create a basic link, you should wrap your text inside an < a > tag in your html elements 
2. The href attribute containts the link itself that you are refferencing in your < a > element. 
3. To ensure pages are accessible to all readers you must make sure that the title of the link is descriptive and in the regular text of the link so it reads aloud to the user

## CSS Layout Normal Flow CSS Layout: Positioning
---
1. Normal flow in css is the way html elements lay themselves out by default in the browser when un-altered intentionally
2. Block-level elements will usually have line breaks in them and take up several lines where as inline elements will take up a single line and not take up more space by moving down a line. 
3. Static positioning is the standard html element positioning, elements render in order of document flow.
4. Absolute positioning can be an advantage because of its ability to take its position from the next relative parent element, and if there is none present then it defaults to postioning relative to the browser window. 
5. Fixed positioning is relative to browser window, while absolute positioning is relative to the parent element

## Functions - Reusable Blocks of Code
1.Declaring a function is the defining of the function when you create it. Invoking a function is when run or call it
2. A functions parameters are within the function itself, while a functions arguments are what is passed to the function when called or ran
3. Benefits of pair programming are 1, to establish a good team relationship with co-workers/team mates and 2, it enables 2 partys to learn from one another in the observation of how each party thinks and processes problems in scripts
### Things I want to know more about
* I would like to know what the hardest category of coding is within software development, AI, Firmware, Webdevelopment, API's? Maybe this question is nonsensical
