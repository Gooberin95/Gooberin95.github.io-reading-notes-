# JavaScript troubleshooting
* A syntac error is related to the specific character you typed in where as a logic error is something that happens with no syntax errors and is instead an issue with how you built your code. 
* I encountered alot of syntax errors with my code where I had to change the spelling or capitalization of my variable words and sometimes function names. 
* This topic is going to help me acheive my long term goal by helping me make less mistakes because I will be revising my code properly as I type it out not having to re-write alot of it. 
# The JavaScript Debugger
* The JavaScript debugger tool is in the browser and helps you identify which problems are occuring in your code and where, it preety much acts as a TA! in that it will show you where your spelling is wrong or where variable scopes are incorrect ect.
*A breakpoint is a marker you set in the debugger tool that pauses code execution at which ever point you set it to. 
* The call stack is a part of the debugger that shows you which code was executed upto the breakpoint.
