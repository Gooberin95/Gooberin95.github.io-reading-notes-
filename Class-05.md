### HTML Media

1. A real world use case for using the  < alt > attribute is for making your website image accessible for all users, inserting a properly descriptive text for the screen reader to read will allow visually impaired users to still know what is showing up on the web page
2.You can improve the accessibility of images in HTML by adding very accurate descrption text to the img element
3. The figure element is useful for adding captions to your images in HTML documents
4. A gif image is slow and for animation purposes, where as a svg file is very sharp in its rendering and best for icons or still images. Svg is light-weight and Gifs take up more memory and can slow down your website. 
5. I would use an Svg file type to display a screenshot on my website, because the screenshot will not need to be animated and using svg will not contribute heavily to slowing down the webiste.

1. Foreground is preety much behind background, or in other words foreground is the backgrounds background
2. I would add a background and foreground image or theme, then put his articles in well styled and seperated boxes and give him good fonts and navbar decoration
3.Choosing web safe fonts is the biggest thing to consider when selecting which type of fonts you will utilize in your website. 
4.Font-size,font-weight and font-style all make changes to the given css element's text in size, weight and styling. 
5. You can add spacing between letters with "letter-spacing: 12px;" in your css
